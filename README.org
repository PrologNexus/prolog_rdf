#+TITLE: Pro-RDF: Prolog-based RDF library (backend-agnostic)

This library provides RDF support that does not require a specific
backend.  As such, this library is typically used in combination with
one or more of the following backends:

  - [[https://github.com/wouterbeek/Pro-HDT][Pro-HDT]] a disk-based backend using limited memory resource.
  - [[http://github.com/wouterbeek/Pro-RDF-DB][Pro-RDF-DB]] an high-performance, memory-intensive backend.
