** [Virtuoso] CSV character set

Since the default character set for CSV is US-ASCII, the /SPARQL 1.1
Query Results CSV and TSV Formats/ specification recommends UTF-8 to
be set explicitly as part of the Media Type that is send in the
~Accept~ request header, i.e., ~text/csv; charset=utf-8~.

Virtuoso (tested with http://dbpedia.org/sparql replies with a 406
(Not Accepted) HTTP status code.

** [Virtuoso] JSON custom keys

JSON result sets contain the following custom keys inside ~binding~
objects: ~distinct~ and ~ordered~ (both taking Boolean values).

** [Virtuoso] No support for SPARQL 1.1 Protocol direct POST

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -H "Accept: application/sparql-results+json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/sparql-query" \
     --data "select (count(*) as ?n) { ?s ?p ?o }" \
     "http://dbpedia.org/sparql"
#+END_SRC

I get the following back: ~< HTTP/1.1 409 Invalid path~
