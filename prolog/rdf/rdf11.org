** Equivalence
RDF11 implements RDF literal equality with `(==)/2`.
According to the standard, two literals are equivalent if:
   1. The strings of the two lexical forms compare equal, character by character.
   2. Either both or neither have language tags.
   3. The language tags, if any, compare equal.
   4. Either both or neither have datatype URIs.
   5. The two datatype URIs, if any, compare equal, character by character.
